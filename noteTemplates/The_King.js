"# The King\n---------------\n\nThe King is a 2019 epic historical war drama film based on several plays from William Shakespeare's \"Henriad\". The film is directed by David Michôd and co-written by Michôd and Joel Edgerton, who both produced the film with Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Liz Watts.\n\n![alt text](https://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/the-king-movie-review-2019/the-king-movie-review-2019.jpg)\n\nThe film includes an ensemble cast led by Timothée Chalamet as Henry, Prince of Wales alongside Robert Pattinson, Ben Mendelsohn, Joel Edgerton, Sean Harris, Dean-Charles Chapman and Lily-Rose Depp in supporting roles with Mendelsohn as King Henry IV. The film focuses on the rise of Henry V as king after his father dies as he also must navigate palace politics, the war his father left behind, and the emotional strings of his past life.\n\nThe King premiered on Venice Film Festival on September 2, 2019 and was released digitally via Netflix on October 11, 2019. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the cinematography and performances (particularly Chalamet and Pattinson's), yet deemed it less than its production values.\n\nSooner or later, Timothée Chalamet was bound to be enthroned with a meaty lead role in a historical epic. Among the most exciting actors of his generation at 23 years of age, he lands on the perfect canvas to marry his stage-imbued talent, soulful gravitas and undeniable movie-star charisma in “Animal Kingdom” director David Michôd’s “The King,” a smartly modern take on Shakespeare, loosely based on “Henriad.” It’s an expansive medieval picture that takes sophisticated liberties with the Bard’s work, expressly with an eye towards presenting history and its contemporary lessons in an accessible fashion to a new age group. And who can draw that crowd in better than young Chalamet with a most dedicated fan base? As the hard-partying, apathetic yet peace-oriented prince Hal who reluctantly becomes King Henry V of England in 1413, Chalamet manages to pull off something youthful and mature in equal measure, complete with a brooding gaze and a serious haircut.\n\n\n![alt text](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/7e1/b10/4da208acaa1427b6df2996a1a4538cfdea-01-the-king-haricuts-lede.rsocial.w1200.jpg)\n\n\nBut before he gets perplexed and devoured by his inherited power, and before the fabled Battle of Agincourt arrives, we naturally meet Prince Hal first. Sporting Chalamet’s famous, mid-parted locks, Hal unreservedly womanizes and boozes alongside his equally nonchalant friend and trusted mentor Falstaff (Joel Edgerton, also a co-writer with Michôd), a relegated knight now involved in small-time dealings in Eastcheap. The ruthless, war-mongering Henry IV (a severe and bad-tempered Ben Mendelsohn, aptly intimidating) is still in power, though it’s unclear for how much longer due to his failing health. The joint screenplay from Edgerton and Michôd sadly rushes through this bit, although not before we can take in the body count on a massive battlefield and get a shot of the unruly nobleman Hotspur (Tom Glynn-Carney), whom Hal would duel against later, on the royal road to become his father’s inevitable successor. It just happens in a mad rush—before we know it, Henry IV goes the way of all flesh and his beautiful boy halfheartedly comes of age under the weight of a shiny crown.\n\n“The King” slashes through the heart of this hesitation, giving us a clear picture of a young person split between his newfound responsibilities and pacifist-leaning beliefs. Making this quiet, different version of Henry V his own interpretation (instead of, you know, a poor imitation of Sir Laurence Olivier’s definitive performance), Chalamet excels at emoting sharply through his eyes. When he has words to spare, it helps that the co-scribes had significantly (though respectfully) smoothened Shakespearean language for this side of the 21st Century. Would Hal just become his dad whom he once loathed (an eternally-relevant existential question at the center of many therapy sessions today)? Can he trust anyone? And what about that condescending ball sent by the Dauphin of France (a hilarious, scene-stealing Robert Pattinson)—should he really take offense like he’s advised to?\n\n\n![alt text](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyZTJiZWQtMzcxYy00NTE5LWIxN2UtZjFiNzgyYTRlNGNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg)\n\n\nAlso sidestepping a poorly attempted replication of the ultimate version of his character (Orson Welles in “Chimes at Midnight,” that is) Edgerton as a larger-than-life, irritable yet subtle Falstaff wisely reminds Hal the reality of his situation: “A king has no friends. Only foes and followers.” Case in point—growing into his throne with a series of dubious decisions, Hal does abandon his one true ally Falstaff for a while, making us sorely miss the gifted Australian actor with pronounced roots in Shakespeare and theater."
